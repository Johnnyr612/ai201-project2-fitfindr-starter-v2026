The runs your test needs. ← UNIT 4, MILESTONE 3

Each of your five criteria needs something run against it. A criterion about
the empty-search branch needs an impossible query. One about the fit card needs
the same item run more than once. Working that out is Milestone 3's first step,
and this file is where you write it down.

`run_eval.py` runs everything here five times and writes the run log — five
because your criteria are written out of five.

Each numbered criterion has a scenario. The fit-card scenario is run five
times with the same query, so it repeatedly selects the same listing. The
empty-wardrobe scenario is retained as an unscored diagnostic.
